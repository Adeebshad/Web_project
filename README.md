# JavaScript_DOM_Project
In this project I have only worked on DOM portion. I have tried to build a project here to understand how to interact with HTML to JavaScript.
It is a game with some rules.
1. Everytime someone will roll the dice with ROLL DICE button.
2. Hold button will take the value to add with main score.
3. Match will end when score reach to 20.
4. If anybody dice value become 1. It will make empty the point score and make turn for the other player.
