        <p class="main_text">An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that constitutes a chemical element. Every solid,
            liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small, typically around
            100 picometers across. They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical
            physics—as if they were billiard balls, for example—is not possible due to quantum effects. Current atomic
            models use quantum principles to better explain and predict this behavior.

        <p class="main_text" id ="opt_text"> Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which
            is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
            The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat,while the bowling and
            fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").
